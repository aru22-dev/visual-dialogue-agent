# 🎯 Visual Dialog Agent Based on Deep Q Learning and Memory Module Network

A Deep Learning-powered **Visual Dialog Agent** that understands and interacts with images using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision**. This project combines **End-to-End Memory Module Networks** with **Reinforcement Learning** to create an engaging and interactive AI capable of answering relational and non-relational questions intelligently.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Uses **End-to-End Memory Module Networks** for structured reasoning  
✅ Implements **Deep Q Learning** to optimize responses based on user inclination  
✅ Supports **both relational and non-relational** question answering  
✅ Trained on **CLEVR and VQA datasets**  
✅ Efficient **dialog memory** for human-like conversation 

## 📊 Performance

📈 **Accuracy:**  
- Non-Relational Questions: **98.1%**  
- Relational Questions: **75.52%**
